                <p>A Pet-Adoption website was the idea of one of my friends. I asked for some inspiration, 
                    I wanted something to create a website for during lockdown 2020. My mate said, "make a pet adoption website" - and I did.
                    This website offers nothing more than aesthic, it is not functional or responsive in anyway, but it looks great.
                </p>

                    <p>The website that you're currently viewing this on, is one of my current projects. Currently, the website is still in the very early stages.
                        There is a lot fo work to do, I hope to make it far more responsive and beautiful using JavaScript. Watch this space.
                        While the website is still in development, the only way to access it is through GitHub.
